    Information Collected via the Site
 
The Site is intended primarily to offer information about BirdSong and the services we provide.
 
We may collect information about you during your use of the Site, such as the server your computer is logged onto

  <h3>2.	THE SERVICES</h3>
  <p><pre>
    Overview of BirdSong’s Services
 
BirdSong collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online via BirdSong’s 
technology provider (the “Technology”). You may encounter the Technology when:

•	when you open an email that contains an advertisement placed by BirdSong or one of our Advertisers; and/or
•	when one of the Advertisers places one of BirdSong’s web beacons on a website that you visit.
•	We use the information collected by the Technology in order to help make the Advertisements you see more relevant to you,
 and for Advertisement delivery and reporting purposes.
 
Information Collected via the Services
 
The Technology collects and uses information regarding your interaction with the Services, including, without limitation, 
the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Advertiser webpages have been viewed,
 search terms entered on Advertiser websites, referral URLs, and the date and time of website visits.

to tailor advertisement placements for BirdSong’s Advertisers accordingly. This information may be shared with third parties 
(see the “Disclosure of Information to Third Parties” section below). This information will not be used by BirdSong to contact or
 identify any person individually.

BirdSong uses cookies and web beacons in connection with the Technology. These cookies and web beacons are served by our existing 
and future technology partners, including but not limited to Brandscreen, TubeMogul, Doubleclick(Google), Turn and Adap.TV, Appnexus,
 Mediamath etc.. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. Certain cookies, persistent cookies, 
 remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your 
 browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
  You can also remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Cookies help BirdSong 
  better understand the effectiveness of a BirdSong Advertisement (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, and interact 
  with, a BirdSong Advertisement, or the location and context in which you view a BirdSong Advertisement). BirdSong ‘s cookies may also help
   control the number of times you view a BirdSong Advertisement.

 interacted with a certain email, along with additional information that the website or email may choose to include with the beacon.

 any third party other than in connection with the Site and the Services.
