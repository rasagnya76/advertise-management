    <h1>BIRDSONG TERMS & CONDIITONS</h1>
    <h6><pre>
        BIRDSONG AD AGENCY Pty Ltd (“BirdSong”) shall perform services for Advertiser or, if applicable, 
        Agency on behalf of Advertiser, (collectively “Customer”) pursuant to one or more Insertion Orders 
        (in both the singular and plural “I/O”) incorporating these Standard Terms and Conditions (“T&C’s”). 
        Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the same meaning given to such terms in the I/O.</pre>
    </h6>
    <h3>I. BIRDSONG SERVICES</h3>
    <p><pre>This agreement, in conjunction with the corresponding Insertion Order, shall constitute Advertiser’s, its clients’ 
        and agents’ (herein collectively referred to as “Advertiser”) understanding that BirdSong’s sole obligation is to 
        promote the Advertiser’s product or services by showing banners (“Creative”) provided by the Advertiser on site(s) 
        across the BirdSong Network (the “Agreement”). The submission of a signed Insertion Order by Advertiser to BirdSong is 
        construed as an acceptance of all the rates, terms and conditions under which advertising is sold at that time. Any and all 
        modifications to this Insertion Order are invalid unless acknowledged and accepted in writing by both BirdSong and the 
        Advertiser. Advertiser agrees that BirdSong may, but is not obligated to, display Creative across the entire Sparcmedia
        advertising network or  on specific site(s) and that daily Campaign activity begins at 12:01 AM Eastern Standard Time.
        BirdSong may, at its option, modify the flight date of a Campaign(s) if the creative or linking URL’s: are not delivered
        on time, there are delays due to 3rd party ad-serving, inventory fluctuation or other issues. All rates quoted herein, 
        orally, or through written communications are only valid fourteen (14) days from date of such statement. If no agreement is 
        reached within this time frame BirdSong reserves the right to change rates.</pre></p>


      <h3>  II. DELIVERY MEASUREMENT STANDARDS</h3>

 <p><pre>
    a. BirdSong will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the impressions stated in the Insertion Order in 
    accordance with this Agreement and will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the impressions starting with
     the start date and ending with the end date set forth in this Insertion Order, and will make commercially reasonable 
     efforts to spread such impressions evenly throughout the term of the Agreement unless otherwise instructed by Advertiser.</p></pre>
<p><pre>
    b. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, all invoices created by BirdSong for work performed and delivered 
    shall be in accordance with measurement and tracking performed by BirdSong. BirdSong has adopted the IAB’s 
    (Internet Advertising Bureau, http://www.iabaustralia.co.au) methodology for measuring impressions. Using this methodology, 
    impression delivery guarantees will be considered “met” when the impressions reported by BirdSong meet an Advertiser’s or 
    representative agency’s insertion order.</pre></p>
<p><pre>
    c.In the event that BirdSong has agreed to use Advertiser’s third-party measurements for billing purposes, 
    Advertiser expressly acknowledges that BirdSong may use and consider Advertiser’s third-party measurements 
    via their online reporting systems, or email confirmations from Advertiser’s representatives as a valid, accurate, 
    and a final measurement of their campaign. Advertiser agrees that it will not dispute their third-party login data or 
    data transmitted via email to BirdSong.</p></pre>

    <h3>III. PAYMENT, CREDIT, AND CANCELLATION TERMS</h3>
    <p><pre>
        a. All invoices created by BirdSong for work performed and delivered to the Advertiser shall be 
        based on BirdSong's  measurements and shall be in accordance with measurement andtracking described in 
        the “Delivery Measurement Standards” section. In addition, all payments will be based upon BirdSong's 
        measurements and not based upon Advertiser, its clients, its agents or any third party’s measurements.</pre>
    </p>
    <p><pre>
        b. All payments will be made in advance unless agreed upon otherwise or credit is approved and BirdSong
        is under no obligation to perform agreed upon services until payment is received. Upon approved credit, terms 
        are Net 30 from date of invoice.</pre>
    </p>
    <p><pre>
        c. It is the Advertisers responsibility to validate all impressions, and/or clicks. The Advertiser must 
        report any discrepancies related to their campaign to BirdSong within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence. 
        BirdSong is not liable for any discrepancies not reported within this time frame and Advertiser waives all right, 
        title, and intent to dispute payment to BirdSong based upon any discrepancy not reported within this time frame. 
        All discrepancies must be reported to BirdSong at accounts.au@BirdSong.com.</pre>
    </p>
    <p><pre>
        d. Either party may cancel this Agreement upon providing two (2) weeks written notice via email, 
        fax or Australian Mail. If Advertiser terminates campaign early, payment in full for work performed 
        and delivered up to the modified cancellation date will be owed and due and payable in full.
    </pre></p>
    <p><pre>
        e. If Advertiser fails to pay overdue invoices for previous campaigns, BirdSong reserves the right to 
        immediately terminate any active campaigns.
    </pre></p>
    <p><pre>
        f. In the event Advertiser pays with credit card, Advertiser expressly agrees not to charge back on credit card account. 
        Advertiser agrees to follow dispute resolution agreement as specified in section 10 and 3 herein.
    </pre></p>
    <p><pre>
        g. All payments must be made in Australian funds, unless otherwise agreed upfront. Advertiser understands and agrees that
         in no event, and under no circumstance will data provided by any BirdSong representative constitute final billing numbers.
          Only Invoices emailed directly to Advertisers and Agencies are to be construed as representative of billable amounts.
